# Combating-COVID-With-Nutrition

As COVID-19 pandemic leaves the world reeling, doctors and medical workers on the front lines continue to work tirelessly to bring much needed aid to people who have been impacted by the unrelenting virus. People from every corner of the globe have searched for ways to contribute to the growing research and understanding of the virus. From vaccine breakthroughs to medical imaging to contact tracing, researchers have contributed their fair share to the world’s efforts to combat this pandemic. But what about laymen who want to do their part to help fight the virus? What can individual people and families do to aid in the efforts? Since diet plays a big role in a person’s well-being, investigating what people eat and the nutrition they consume will give insight into how individuals can protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID. One does not need to look further than the dinner table in order to discover ways they can defend against the virus. Perhaps if we can learn to adopt a healthy eating style, we can weather the storm of COVID-19.
